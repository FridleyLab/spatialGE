Description: An R package for the visualization and analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomics data. The functions in spatialGE allow for the study of gene expression in tissue sections via spatial interpolation, RNA-Seq data deconvolution, and autocorrelation statistics, as well as correlation with clinical/phenotype data.
