### When using `readRDS` to load an STList, I get 'Error: vector memory exhausted'. What can I do?
This error results from R's default memoery limits. Provided your computer has 
enough memory to hold an STList in memory, this error message can be overridden by
typing in a Terminal (Mac OS):
```
echo 'R_MAX_VSIZE=100Gb' >> ~/.Renviron
```
Then, close and re-open R and try to load the STList again.
