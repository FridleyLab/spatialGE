\arguments{
\item{x}{an STList}

\item{spot_minreads}{@param spot_maxreads the minimum (or maximum) number of total reads for a spot to be retained}

\item{spot_mingenes}{@param spot_maxgenes the minimum (or maximum) number of non-zero counts for a spot to be retained}

\item{spot_minpct}{@param spot_maxpctExpr the minimum (or maximum) percentage of counts for features defined by \code{spot_pctexpr}
for a spot to be retained. By default, mtDNA genes.}

\item{gene_minreads}{@param gene_maxreads the minimum (or maximum) number of total reads for a gene to be retained}

\item{gene_minspots}{@param gene_maxspots the minimum (or maximum) number of spots with non-zero counts for a gene to be retained}

\item{gene_minpct}{@param gene_maxpct the minimum (or maximum) percentage of spots with non-zero counts for a gene to be retained}

\item{who}{vector of integers (as in \code{x@counts}) or sample names to perform filtering}

\item{rm_tissue}{vector of integers (as in \code{x@counts}) or sample names to remove from STList}

\item{rm_genes}{vector of gene names to remove from STList}

\item{rm_partialgenes}{a expression to match gene names. Useful to remove entire gene classes (for example mtDNA '^MT-')}

\item{spot_pctExpr}{a expression to use with \code{spot_minpct}. By default '^MT-'.}

\description{
Provides methods to remove spots and genes or entire samples.
}
\details{
This function provides methods to filter an STList. It can remove spots or genes
based on absolute counts or percentages. Users can input a expression to be matched
with gene names to calculate percentages (for example \%mtDNA genes).
Note that the function removes counts raw counts and spatial information. Transformed
counts or other results within the STList remain unaffected.
